    "response": "Of course, most people want to make sure they’re not rushing. Out of curiosity though, is it the numbers that feel off… or is it more about timing?"

    "objection": "I need to talk to my spouse.",
    "response": "That makes sense. Just so I understand, is your spouse usually on board with these types of decisions, or are there specific concerns they usually have?"

    "id": 3,
    "objection": "I already have solar.",
    "response": "Totally fair. Can I ask — how’s that been working out for you so far? Are you fully covered, or are you still getting bills?"

    "id": 4,
    "objection": "I don’t want to commit to anything today.",
    "response": "Absolutely, I’m not asking for a yes today. Just so I understand where you’re at, is there something that would need to change in your situation to make this worth exploring?"

    "objection": "I don’t trust these solar companies.",
    "response": "That’s actually more common than you think. What’s got you feeling skeptical — is it something you’ve personally experienced, or just what you’ve heard from others?"

    "objection": "What’s the catch?",
    "response": "Fair question. Most people ask that too. What’s making you feel like there might be one?"

    "id": 7,
    "objection": "I don't want another payment.",
    "response": "Totally get that. Can I ask, is your concern that this would add to your bills — or that it wouldn’t actually reduce what you’re already paying?"
  },
  {
    "id": 8, 
    "objection": "I'm not interested.",
    "response": "Totally fair. Just out of curiosity, when you say you're not interested—is that because you already looked into solar in the past, or because no one's really explained how the newer programs work yet?"
